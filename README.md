# ExpressJS-StarterKit
## Introduction

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, enabling server-side scripting. Express.js is a lightweight web application framework for Node.js, providing powerful tools for building APIs and web servers.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of JavaScript (ES6+ syntax)
- Installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- Familiarity with command-line operations

## Setup

1. Initialize a Node.js project:

   ```bash
   mkdir learning-express
   cd learning-express
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install Express.js:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

3. Create a basic Express server in `app.js`:

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, Express!');
   });

   const PORT = 3000;
   app.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

4. Run the server:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

## Core Concepts

### Middleware

Functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the server. Examples include parsing JSON or handling errors.

### Routing

Defining endpoints and their logic (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### Error Handling

Managing unexpected issues during requests.

### Static Files

Serving assets like HTML, CSS, and images.

## Basic Features

### Routes

Create dynamic endpoints for your application:

```javascript
app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: 'API is working!' });
});
```

### Middleware Usage

Use middleware to handle requests:

```javascript
app.use(express.json()); // Parse JSON bodies
```

### Error Handling Usage

Handle errors gracefully:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send('Something went wrong!');
});
```

## Folder Structure

Organize your application logically:

```plaintext
learning-express/
├── routes/        # Route handlers
├── controllers/   # Business logic for routes
├── middlewares/   # Middleware functions
├── models/        # Database models
├── app.js         # Main Express application
├── package.json   # Project metadata
```

## Common Middleware

- **`express.json()`**: Parses incoming JSON requests.
- **`express.urlencoded()`**: Parses URL-encoded data.
- **Third-party Middleware**: Examples include `cors` for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing and `morgan` for logging.

## Best Practices

1. Use environment variables for sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database URLs).
2. Modularize your code by separating routes, controllers, and middleware.
3. Implement proper error handling.
4. Follow RESTful API conventions.
5. Write tests for critical functionality.
